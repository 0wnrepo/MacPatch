##Creating Patch Groups
A patch group is a custom group of client patches. This allows you to select which patches each group will receive. 
1. The first step is to login to the MacPatch web admin section and choose *Patches -> Patch Group(s) -> Build*
2. Select which patches you want and save the new patch group.
  Warning: Do not use spaces in the Patch Group name.
3. Now that the new patch groups has been created you'll want to assign clients to it. To do this you'll need to edit the `gov.llnl.mp.agent.plist` file one your client systems. This can be done a few ways.
  * Use Apple Remote Desktop's "Send UNIX command" feature to deploy the following command.
```defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.example.mpagent PatchGroup *groupname*```
  * You can also deploy a modified client plist file at the same time you install the client agent.
