MacPatch 2.9 to 3.x Migration Info
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

MPAgentUploader.app can include a migration plist file (migration.plist) as part of the package upload. The migration plist helps migrate clients from one environment to another. 

To migrate from MacPatch 2.9 to 3.x, use the MPAgentUploader to upload the 3.x Agent with the migration.plist to the 2.9 environment. Adjust the agent version so that it can not update the clients. This will only allow the “Updater” to get updated. The “Updater” will schedule the update with the migration info of the new environment and will upgrade and migrate the agent to the MacPatch 3 environment.
