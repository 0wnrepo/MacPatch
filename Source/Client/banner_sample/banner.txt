The banner_sample is the foundation to creating custom banner html for the software view in MacPatch.

By default the MacPatch.app has the html source with in it's resources directory, but if you want to 
use a custom banner, copy the "html" directory to "/Library/MacPatch/Client/Data/MacPatch/banner/default".

There is a "clientgroup" folder as well, this will be managed by the console on future versions.
