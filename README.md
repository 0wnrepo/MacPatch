Started by following the tutorial found here:

# Quickstart

Assuming working on OS X, tested on OS X 10.11.2. `gem` (Ruby package manager)
was preinstalled, so just working from there:

    # Install the dependencies:
    $ gem install jekyll
    $ gem install rdiscount

    # Build and serve the website
    # jekyll serve

    # Browse to (by default) `localhost:4000` in a web browser
