Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory OneLab Template Staticfiles
==================================================================

This repository is meant to be the base for hosting the OneLab web template
static files (css, js, imgs, fonts, etc). Keeping these static files in a
clearly separated fashion allows them to be re-used and plugged into other
theme and template frameworks. The following are a list of a few such
frameworks in use at the laboratory:

* Django
* Jekyll
* ReadTheDocs
* Drupal

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest ways to get started using these static files is either to clone
this repository into the tree of your downstream codebase (e.g. django app), or
to copy the files from this repo into the downstream codebase.

Versioning
----------

For consistency with the existing [OneLab Template](https://onelab.llnl.gov),
the initial rip from that theme of these static files is defined to be version
1.0.
